# Employee_Attrition_Predition

Problem Statement:
In this project we are going to predict which employees in a company are more willingly to leave the company
datascientist => HR team provided you the past data about employees who left and stayed.

You work as a data scientist at this multinational corporation and the HR team has collected some data for you on their employees.
They will be asking you to predict which employees are more likely to quit.
So the HR team collected information about

1.Job Involvement - Are they involved in their jobs or not

2.About their education - Do they have a bachelor's degree and master's degree PHC for example.

3.Job Satisfaction - Are they satisfied for example or not with performance the

4.Relationship Satisfaction with their with their team and with their manager as well

5.and their Work Life Balance as well.

there are almost 35 factors/features the HR team actually provided us to predict the employee retention.

●	Responsibilities:

⮚	Created a new environment to avoid interference in project if any of the packages or libraries get updated in future.

⮚	Collected data from Kaggle.

⮚	Understood the insights of the data by doing extensive EDA by using various plotting techniques with the help of matplotlib and seaborn visualization libraries.

⮚	Performed various feature engineering techniques like handling missing values, cleaning the data, encoding categorical data into numerical data.

⮚	Plotted feature importance plots like Heatmap and ExtraTreeRegressor to find which features are important for the model and to find out the relationship between all the features.

⮚	Applied various machine learning algorithms on the dataset and performed Hyper Parameter Tuning techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomisedSearchCV to find out the best parameters.

 And also	Applied  Artificial neural network  on the dataset and adding input hidden layers and adding output layers then after compiling the ANN.
